## What is SQL?

SQL or structured query language is the native language for interacting with databases and is designed for exactly this purpose. It is a language of databases. A database models real-life entities like professors and universities by storing them in tables. Each table contains data from a single entity type. This reduces redundancy by storing entities only once. For example, there only needs to be one row of data containing a certain company's details. Lastly, a database can be used to model the relationship between entities.
